# You Are An Idiot Remade
The remake of the You are an idiot prankware.

This is NOT an exact remake. I have added my own features to it. It was made in c# using windows forms.

# How to run
In order to run this you need to have dotnet framework version 4.7.2 or higher,

Make sure your antivirus is off otherwise it will delete the exe. [NO LONGER NEEDED (V1.1.0^)]

Run the YouAreAnIdiot.exe as administrator this is because it modifies your registry in order to disable tskmgr.

# Will this hurt my pc?
No. It will not damage, steal, or delete/modify anything other than your registry.

If you are still scared, either run it in a vm or run the safe version included in V1.1.0^

# How do I re-enable task manager?
Open up regedit, then go to: Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System and set the "DisableTskMgr" dword to 0 instead of 1.

# How do I stop it from opening on startup?
Press WIN + R and type: "%appdata%" and press ok/enter,

Go to Microsoft->Windows->Start Menu->Programs->Startup and delete "YouAreAnIdiot"
